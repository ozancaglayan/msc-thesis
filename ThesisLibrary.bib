	abstract = {The locked-in syndrome ({LiS)} was broken down on the basis of neurological symptoms in 12 patients. The criteria of classical {LiS} are total immobility except for vertical eye movements and blinking. If any other movements are present one should consider the condition as incomplete {LiS.} Total immobility, including all eye movements, combined with signs of undisturbed cortical function in the {EEG} led to the concept of total {LiS.} The anatomical basis for this condition consists of lesions in both cerebral peduncles which interrupt the pyramidal and corticobulbar tracts, the supranuclear fibers for horizontal gaze and the postnuclear oculomotor fibers. As to the course, chronic and transient {LiS} have been described.},

	abstract = {Cognitive monitoring is an approach utilizing realtime brain signal decoding ({RBSD)} for gaining information on the ongoing cognitive user state. In recent decades this approach has brought valuable insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated {RBSD} can be used to set up a brain–computer interface ({BCI)} providing a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain activity. In {BCIs} the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands to control the connected computer system or to communicate through it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing {BCI} technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional states to the technical system. We call this approach passive {BCI.} In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive {BCI}, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from {BCI} technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users, and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with {BCI} technology is very similar to the concept of {BCIs} itself we propose a unifying categorization of {BCI-based} applications, including the novel approach of passive {BCI.}},
