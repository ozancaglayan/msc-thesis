	abstract = {Motor imagery can modify the neuronal activity in the primary sensorimotor areas in a very similar way as observable with a real executed movement. One part of {EEG-based} brain-computer interfaces ({BCI)} is based on the recording and classification of circumscribed and transient {EEG} changes during different types of motor imagery such as, e.g., imagination of left-hand, right-hand, or foot movement. Features such as, e.g., band power or adaptive autoregressive parameters are either extracted in bipolar {EEG} recordings overlaying sensorimotor areas or from an array of electrodes located over central and neighboring areas. For the classification of the features, linear discrimination analysis and neural networks are used. Characteristic for the Graz {BCI} is that a classifier is set up in a learning session and updated after one or more sessions with online feedback using the procedure of “rapid prototyping.” As a result, a discrimination of two brain states (e.g., leftversus right-hand movement imagination) can be reached within only a few days of training. At this time, a tetraplegic patient is able to operate an {EEG-based} control of a hand orthosis with nearly 100\% classification accuracy by mental imagination of specific motor commands},

	abstract = {Brain computer interface ({BCI)} technology has been proposed for motor neurorehabilitation, motor replacement and assistive technologies. It is an open question whether proprioceptive feedback affects the regulation of brain oscillations and therefore {BCI} control. We developed a {BCI} coupled on-line with a robotic hand exoskeleton for flexing and extending the fingers. 24 healthy participants performed five different tasks of closing and opening the hand: (1) motor imagery of the hand movement without any overt movement and without feedback, (2) motor imagery with movement as online feedback (participants see and feel their hand, with the exoskeleton moving according to their brain signals, (3) passive (the orthosis passively opens and closes the hand without imagery) and (4) active (overt) movement of the hand and rest. Performance was defined as the difference in power of the sensorimotor rhythm during motor task and rest and calculated offline for different tasks. Participants were divided in three groups depending on the feedback receiving during task 2 (the other tasks were the same for all participants). Group 1 (n = 9) received contingent positive feedback (participants' sensorimotor rhythm ({SMR)} desynchronization was directly linked to hand orthosis movements), group 2 (n = 8) contingent “negative” feedback (participants' sensorimotor rhythm synchronization was directly linked to hand orthosis movements) and group 3 (n = 7) sham feedback (no link between brain oscillations and orthosis movements). We observed that proprioceptive feedback (feeling and seeing hand movements) improved {BCI} performance significantly. Furthermore, in the contingent positive group only a significant motor learning effect was observed enhancing {SMR} desynchronization during motor imagery without feedback in time. Furthermore, we observed a significantly stronger {SMR} desynchronization in the contingent positive group compared to the other groups during active and passive movements. To summarize, we demonstrated that the use of contingent positive proprioceptive feedback {BCI} enhanced {SMR} desynchronization during motor tasks.},

	shorttitle = {Electric Fields of the Brain},
	abstract = {Electroencephalography ({EEG)} is practiced by neurologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and others interested in functional brain imaging. Whether for clinical or experimental purposes, all studies share a common purpose-to relate scalp potentials to the underlying neurophysiology. Electrical potentials on the scalp exhibit spatial and temporal patterns that depend on the nature and location of the sources and the way that currents and fields spread through tissue. Because these dynamic patterns are correlated with behavior and cognition, {EEG} provides a "window on the mind," correlating physiology and psychology.  This classic and widely acclaimed text, originally published in 1981, filled the large gap between {EEG} and the physical sciences. It has now been brought completely up to date and will again serve as an invaluable resource for understanding the principles of electric fields in living tissue and for using hard science to study human consciousness and cognition. No comparable volume exists for it is no easy task to explain the problems of {EEG} in clear language, with mathematics presented mainly in appendices. Among the many topics covered by the Second Edition are micro and meso (intermediate scale) synaptic sources, electrode placement, choice of reference, volume conduction, power and coherence measures, projection of scalp potentials to dura surface, dynamic signatures of conscious experience, neural networks immersed in global fields of synaptic action, and physiological bases for brain source dynamics. The Second Edition is an invaluable resource for neurologists, neuroscientists (especially cognitive neuroscientists), biomedical engineers, and their students and trainees. It will also appeal to physicists, mathematicians, computer scientists, psychiatrists, and industrial engineers interested in {EEG.}},

	abstract = {Recent advances in signal analysis have engendered {EEG} with the status of a true brain mapping and brain imaging method capable of providing spatio-temporal information regarding brain (dys)function. Because of the increasing interest in the temporal dynamics of brain networks, and because of the straightforward compatibility of the {EEG} with other brain imaging techniques, {EEG} is increasingly used in the neuroimaging community. However, the full capability of {EEG} is highly underestimated. Many combined {EEG-fMRI} studies use the {EEG} only as a spike-counter or an oscilloscope. Many cognitive and clinical {EEG} studies use the {EEG} still in its traditional way and analyze grapho-elements at certain electrodes and latencies. We here show that this way of using the {EEG} is not only dangerous because it leads to misinterpretations, but it is also largely ignoring the spatial aspects of the signals. In fact, {EEG} primarily measures the electric potential field at the scalp surface in the same way as {MEG} measures the magnetic field. By properly sampling and correctly analyzing this electric field, {EEG} can provide reliable information about the neuronal activity in the brain and the temporal dynamics of this activity in the millisecond range. This review explains some of these analysis methods and illustrates their potential in clinical and experimental applications.},

	abstract = {Cognitive monitoring is an approach utilizing realtime brain signal decoding ({RBSD)} for gaining information on the ongoing cognitive user state. In recent decades this approach has brought valuable insight into the cognition of an interacting human. Automated {RBSD} can be used to set up a brain–computer interface ({BCI)} providing a novel input modality for technical systems solely based on brain activity. In {BCIs} the user usually sends voluntary and directed commands to control the connected computer system or to communicate through it. In this paper we propose an extension of this approach by fusing {BCI} technology with cognitive monitoring, providing valuable information about the users' intentions, situational interpretations and emotional states to the technical system. We call this approach passive {BCI.} In the following we give an overview of studies which utilize passive {BCI}, as well as other novel types of applications resulting from {BCI} technology. We especially focus on applications for healthy users, and the specific requirements and demands of this user group. Since the presented approach of combining cognitive monitoring with {BCI} technology is very similar to the concept of {BCIs} itself we propose a unifying categorization of {BCI-based} applications, including the novel approach of passive {BCI.}},

	abstract = {Objective: A system for electrode placement is described. It is designed for studies on topography and source analysis of spontaneous and evoked {EEG} activity.

Method: The proposed system is based on the extended International 10–20 system which contains 74 electrodes, and extends this system up to 345 electrode locations.

Results: The positioning and nomenclature of the electrode system is described, and a subset of locations is proposed as especially useful for modern {EEG/ERP} systems, often having 128 channels available.

Conclusion: Similar to the extension of the 10–20 system to the 10–10 system (‘10\% system’), proposed in 1985, the goal of this new extension to a 10–5 system is to further promote standardization in high-resolution {EEG} studies.},
